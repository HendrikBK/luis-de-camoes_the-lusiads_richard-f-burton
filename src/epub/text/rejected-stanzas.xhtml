				<h2 epub:type="title">The Rejected Stanzas</h2>
				<p>These Stanzas, omitted by Camões, were discovered by Manoel de Faria y Sousa, and published in his Commentaries (Juan Sanches, 1639). The whole are extant in three manuscripts. Number <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>, the better of the two first, contains only six cantos: Number <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>, belonging to <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">M.</abbr> Correia Montenegro, embraces the whole poem. The third <abbr>MS.</abbr>, in the hands of <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">M.</abbr> Luiz Franco, is given by Viscount Juromenha (<abbr>Vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> 419). It has only four “rejected stanzas”; the first three are those of Faria y Sousa; and the fourth is that of the established text (Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 79) with a few unimportant changes of words and rhymes.</p>

				<p>I will not here enter into the consideration why the Stanzas were left out. Many of them fully equal those retained in the popular “Lusiads”; but almost all contain something opposed to public, or rather to priestly, sentiment. A cursory glance shows that not a few want the polish and finish which distinguish the Poem. I have purposely followed suit for the sake of contrast and fidelity. Juromenha’s original text is printed <i>in verso</i>, that the reader may judge how literal is my version, which, for additional security, was submitted to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J. J.</abbr> Aubertin, the translator of “The Lusiads.”</p>
