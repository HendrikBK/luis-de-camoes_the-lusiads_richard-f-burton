				<h2>Canto VII.</h2>
				<h3>Argument<br/>
				of the Seventh Canto.</h3>
				<p>On the occasion of the famous Discovery of India, a notable and poetic Exhortation is addrest to the Princes of Christendom, arousing them to like Enterprizes: Description of the Reign of Malabar wherein lieth the Empire of Calecut, at whose Port the Armada anchoreth: Appeareth the Moor Monsaydé who giveth information to the Gama and eke instructeth him concerning the natives of the land: The Catual, or Governor of Calecut, fareth to see the Fleet.</p>
				<h3>Another Argument.</h3>

				<br/>
				<span class="i2">to the despatch he will due care extend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">whereby their King shall greet their homeward way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">This said, brought sombre Night the wonted end</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">to human labours of the livelong Day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>soothing the weary limbs with balmy swoon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>and tirèd eyne with sweet Oblivion’s boon.</span>

			<p>
				<span>The Gama, with his Portingalls remainèd,<span class="linenum">66</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">whom, upon hospitable thought intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">the noble Indian Regent entertainèd</span>

				<span class="i2">with feast and joy and general content.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The Cat’ual, to his monarch’s service trainèd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">sought surest tidings; ’twas his regiment</span>
				<br/>
				<span>to learn how, when, and whence the Folk had come,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>what laws were theirs, what customs, and what home.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Soon as he saw the Delian Car of fire<span class="linenum">67</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">the fair Youth drives, come forth and light restore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">he summoneth Monsaydé for desire</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">to know the strangers new to th’ Indian shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Ready and curious now he ’gins enquire</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">if certain signs, pure proofs, the Moorman bore</span>

				<br/>
				<span>hard by his country they were born and bred:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That punct’ual proof partic’ular he must bring<span class="linenum">68</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">with general information; as ’twould be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">notable service done to tell the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">all that could guide him in such novelty.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Rejoins Monsaydé:—“Alb’eit ev’erything</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">I lief recount, yet count it not from me:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I only ken they bide in distant Spain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>where bathe my nest and Phœbus in the Main.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“They hold a Prophet’s Law who was begot<span class="linenum">69</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">sinless, nor stained with carnal detriment</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">His Virgin-Mother; Him the Breath<a class="note-anchor pginternal" href="#note-14" id="noteref-14">[14]</a> they wot</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">of God who holdeth Earth in government.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">But what my sires ancestral ne’er forgot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">of them, is Valour fierce, sanguinolent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>in arms, that on their arm resplendent gloweth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>as many a Geste with our forefathers showeth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For they, with brav’ery better than of man,<span class="linenum">70</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">outdrave our grandsires from the fertile leas</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">where fresh Guadiána and rich Tagus ran,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">with famed and memorable instances:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Still seeking triumphs, in far African</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">parts, spurning perils of the stormy seas</span>
				<br/>
				<span>our plans of safety and of peace they foil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>they break our lofty walls, our towns they spoil.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nor less of force and fraud they showed, whene’er<span class="linenum">71</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">kindled were other wars by Fate’s decree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">or when Spain’s warlike sons to fight would fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">or there, when others poured down Pyrenee:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And thus, in fine, to thrust of foreign spear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">ne’er bowed they, owning alien mastery</span>
				<br/>
				<span>ne’er yet was known, I swear no man can tell us</span>
				<br/>
				<span>to Hannibals like these e’er came Marcellus.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And if my tidings faulty seem and few,<span class="linenum">72</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">what thou requirest that to ask them send;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">ask of themselves, for they be proud and true</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">and falsehoods most annoy them and offend:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Go see their fleet and arms, their manner view</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Flamed with desire the Idol-servant’s mind<span class="linenum">73</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">to sight the marvels told him by the Moor:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">He bade the boats be manned, and straight incline’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">to view the vessels which the Gama bore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Both leave the foreshore, and their boat behind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">came Nayran hosts, till Ocean curdled o’er:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They scale the Flagship’s gunwales strong and tall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>and, reacht the main-deck, are received by Paul.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her purple awnings and her banners shine<span class="linenum">74</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">with the rich tissue which the worm hath made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">whereon appear portray’d with rare design</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">the warlike actions of the mighty Dead:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Here show fierce accidents of ’battled line,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">and there fere single-fights, a scene of dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>wherefrom the Géntoo seeking all to ’spy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>may not withdraw the pleasure of his eye.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He asks of all he sees: But Gama pray’d<span class="linenum">75</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">he first be seated, and in cool retreat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">be pleased to taste the food before him spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">which Epicurus’ sect holds highest treat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The spumy vases gen’erous liquors shed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">which first did Noah make the world to weet:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet nills the Géntoo-man to break his fast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>as ’twas forbidden by the laws of Caste.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The blaring Trumpet, which in Peace the thought<span class="linenum">76</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">of Warfare im’ages, rends the lift like thunder:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The diabolick instruments fire-fraught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">wake slumb’ering echoes there, the sea-depths under.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Noted the Géntoo all: But most he sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">to read th’ intention and the works of wonder</span>
				<br/>
				<span>done by the Heroes which in scanty space</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Picture, mute Poesy, had power to trace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He riseth, Gama rising by his side,<span class="linenum">77</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">and there Coelho with the Mauritan:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">With curious eyne a warlike form they eye’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">an old white Sire of aspect sovereign,</span>

				<span class="i2">whose name and honours in our hearts shall ’bide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">long as the World shall know the name of man:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In garb of Grecian usage stands he dight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>bearing device of leaf-branch in his right.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His right a leaf-branch bore:—But oh! how blind<span class="linenum">78</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">I madly rush to ’tempt without your stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">ye Nymphs of Tagus and Mondego kind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">a path so varied, long and ard’uous way!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Lend me your favour while my way shall wind</span>

				<span>for sore I fear me an ye leave the helm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>the waves my fragile barque shall overwhelm.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>See how my Lay so long to sing hath striven<span class="linenum">79</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">your Tagus and the Lusians dear to you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">how oft this exile Fate from home hath driven,</span>

				<span class="i2">new labours ever suff’ering, losses new:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Now tempting Ocean, then all helpless driven</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">the dread Mavortian risks and wrongs to rue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>self-doomed as Canacé to death abhor’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>in this hand aye the Pen, in that the Sword:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now sunk by hateful scornèd Penury<span class="linenum">80</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">to chew the bitter bit of beggar-bread:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Then mockt by Hope already brought so nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">to be anew and more than e’er misled:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Then with bare life in hand condemned to fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">where life depended from so fine a thread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>only a greater miracle could save,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>than what to Judah’s King<a class="note-anchor pginternal" href="#note-15" id="noteref-15">[15]</a> new life-lease gave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And still, my Nymphs! ’twas not enough of pain<span class="linenum">81</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">such sorrow-clouds around my life should close;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">but they, for whom I sang the patriot-strain,</span>

				<span class="i2">In place of Peace and Rest I hoped to gain,</span>

				<span class="i2">in lieu of Bay-wreaths bound around my brows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>troubles by men unseen they must invent,</span>

				<span>when ills of every kind my soul torment.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Behold, ye Nymphs! what high-bred Lords and wise<span class="linenum">82</span></span>

				<span class="i2">breedeth your Tagus, what a gen’erous race,</span>

				<span class="i2">the Bard whose boon hath lent their lordships grace!</span>

				<span>on pain of losing all my pow’er to please.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Think not, ah no, my Nymphs! I would enfame<span class="linenum">84</span></span>

				<span class="i2">the man who dares his country and his King</span>

				<br/>
				<span>in new-born rank his King contenting more,</span>
